Description:
Welcome to my 20-day challenge to revise, learn, and master DBMS (Database Management Systems) and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)! ðŸš€

User ID: jagrit80

In this repository, Iâ€™m documenting my personal journey of revisiting and deepening my understanding of essential concepts related to DBMS and JDBC, key technologies for anyone working with databases and Java applications. The project is structured around a 20-day challenge, where I review core topics, solve exercises, and implement practical projects using these concepts.

What to Expect in This Repository:
Daily Learning Updates: Every day, I'll upload code, notes, and summaries of the topics I have covered, including DBMS theory and JDBC practical implementations.
  Key Topics Covered:
   â€¢ Database Management Systems (DBMS):
   â€¢ Relational Database Design
   â€¢ SQL Queries (CRUD operations, Joins, Aggregations, etc.)
   â€¢ Normalization and Denormalization
   â€¢ Transaction Management and Concurrency Control
   â€¢ Indexing and Query Optimization
   â€¢ Java Database Connectivity (JDBC):
   â€¢ Setting up JDBC connections
   â€¢ Executing SQL commands using JDBC
   â€¢ Handling ResultSets, PreparedStatements, and Exceptions
   â€¢ Integration with popular databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
   â€¢ Best practices and optimizations for JDBC
**Goal of the Challenge:**
The primary aim of this 20-day challenge is to solidify my theoretical knowledge of DBMS and JDBC while demonstrating real-world applications. By documenting and sharing my progress here on GitHub, I hope to:

Showcase my learning journey: This repo serves as a portfolio of my work and progress, making it easier to track how I approach these complex topics.
Help others: If you're also learning DBMS and JDBC, feel free to follow my journey, learn from the resources I share, or contribute with your suggestions and improvements.
Improve practical skills: Iâ€™ll be coding frequently, experimenting with database queries, optimizing SQL performance, and integrating databases with Java through JDBC, ensuring a hands-on approach to learning.
Why Follow This Repository?
If you're looking for structured, daily updates on mastering DBMS and JDBC, this project will be a valuable resource.
You'll find practical code examples and project implementations that demonstrate key database concepts and Java database interaction.
The repository is open to contributions and discussions, and I welcome anyone who wants to share their insights or collaborate.
Technologies Used:
Java (for JDBC)
MySQL / PostgreSQL (for database integration)
SQL (for querying and database management)
